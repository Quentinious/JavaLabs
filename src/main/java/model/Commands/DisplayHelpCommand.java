                Bulls and Cows is a logic-based game where one player thinks of a number (usually a 4-digit number with unique digits), and the other player tries to guess it.
                
                    Bull: A digit is correct and in the right position.
                
                    Cow: A digit is correct but in the wrong position.
                
                The goal is to guess the number in the fewest attempts.
